## Description

'Real Debrid Media Manager' is a project created with the intention of streamlining the process of syncing a users 'Trakt' data with their 'Real-Debrid' account and although such scripts and websites already exist, they pose the issue of not supporting 'Trakt' and instead do so for other services: 'IMDB'.
